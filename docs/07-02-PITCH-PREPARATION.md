## Judge Persuasion Strategy

### Coinbase (x402 Sponsor) Appeal Points

"Pag0 fills Phase 3 of the x402 ecosystem, the Platform layer. Protocol alone is not enough. Just as Auth0 created $6.5B in value on top of OAuth, we're building essential infrastructure on top of x402. We'll be the key tool to increase x402 adoption rates."

### SKALE (Zero Gas Sponsor) Appeal Points

"Pag0 processes all payments with SKALE's Zero Gas. When agents make thousands of payments per day, zero gas fees are essential. We're creating a killer use case for SKALE."

### The Graph (Subgraph Sponsor) Appeal Points

"If Pag0's analytics data is provided through The Graph subgraph, it will increase transparency across the entire x402 ecosystem. The integration of on-chain payment data + off-chain usage data creates powerful synergy."

### Google Cloud (ADK Sponsor) Appeal Points

"Pag0 solves compliance requirements for enterprise AI agents. When agents built with Google ADK use Pag0 for spend management, enterprise adoption rates will increase."

### Virtuals (G.A.M.E. SDK Sponsor) Appeal Points

"Game agents have extremely high API call volumes. Without Pag0's caching and cost optimization, game economies would collapse. We'll integrate with Virtuals G.A.M.E. SDK to strengthen gaming use cases."
