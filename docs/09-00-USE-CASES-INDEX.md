## Common Pattern: 3-in-1 Value

```yaml
Across all use cases:

  1. Spend Firewall (Control):
     - Set budget limits
     - Block policy violations
     - Anomaly detection and alerts

  2. Data-Driven Curation (Optimization):
     - Collect real usage data
     - Objective API comparisons
     - Automated optimization recommendations

  3. Smart Cache (Savings):
     - Prevent duplicate payments
     - Average 40% cost savings
     - Improved response speed

Results:
  - Cost: 30-50% reduction
  - Risk: 90%+ reduction
  - Productivity: Save 5-10 developer hours/week
  - Automation: Improved operational efficiency through automated decision-making
